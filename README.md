# Capstone Proposal

For my capstone project i'd like to showcase a working POC of how, through the use of containerisation, how quickly we could implement a full CI/CD pipeline that brings immediate benefits to my company

## Features to Showcase

### Automation

I want to highlight how we can bring an automation framework very easily and one that can be expanded as the complexity of the product also increases. 

I will show case these by focusing on:

- CI/CD Pipeline
- Linting & Testing on every push
- Deployments triggered by events
- Frequency of deployments

### Infrastructure as Code

For this i'd like to focus on how this will allow us to progress as a GitOps project by highlighting the major benefits of IAC:

- Infrastructure can now be peer reviewed as part of regular coding practices
- Reduce the risk of issue by removing any manual work

### Visability

DevOps is the combination of "Dev" & "Ops" and as such i'd like to focus on bringing visibility and access to our entire CI/CD pipeline to as many teams as possible. The main aims here are to:

- Promote transparency
- Integrate teams and highlight our common goals
- Fascilitating any developer being able to improve their own CI/CD pipeline and to feel part of the process. DevOps' aim to automate work for as many people as possible
- Show when things are not working as well as when they are not

### Blue/Green Deployments

This will be an essential selling point to the business as it represents:

- A massive reduction in deployment risk
- Allows us to deploy more often and bring features to users more often
